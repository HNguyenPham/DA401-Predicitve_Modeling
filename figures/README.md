# Result Folder

This folder contains all output files generated from the analysis, including model results, diagnostic plots, and summary tables. These files are produced automatically by the analysis scripts for easy access and review.

## Contents  
- Model output files (e.g., regression tables, feature importance)  
- Diagnostic plots (e.g., ROC curves, VIF plot)  
- Summary tables and reports  
- Any additional export files generated during the analysis  

## Usage  
Results are organized for straightforward interpretation and reporting. Avoid manually modifying files here, as they are overwritten by script runs. For reproducibility, always rerun analysis scripts to update results.
