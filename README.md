## Project Title
Identifying Physical Design Flaws in Commercial Aircraft With A Predictive Modeling Approach
## Research Question
What are some of the most common physical design flaws in commercial-use aircraft that contribute to accidents? 
## Data Source
In this project, I will employ data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to answer our exploratory question. 

## Methods
I will explore the data and build models by summarizing accident trends by aircraft type, creating dummy variables for accident classification, and testing Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. I will then compare their performance using AUC. 

## Expected Timeline
The project will be carried out in four main phases over the semester. From September 9 to September 18, I will focus on cleaning the NTSB dataset and conducting a literature
review for a theoretical foundation. Between September 23 and October 7, I will explore the data and build models by summarizing accident trends by aircraft type, creating dummy variables for accident classification, and testing Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, followed by comparing their performance with AUC. This metric measures how well models distinguish between design-related and non-design-related accidents. During October 9 and December 11, I will refine findings, generate visualizations, and produce drafts of both the research paper and presentation, which will also undergo peer review. Finally, by December 15, I will present my findings and finalize the research paper, ensuring that all outputs, including the cleaned dataset, reproducible R scripts, and predictive model which are ready for submission.
